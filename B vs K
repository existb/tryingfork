    (10-20% dmg up, 5-10 heal, 10-20% dmg reduction, doubled effect skill)

2)  every turn, each player choosing skill first, after that there is a random phenomenon
    (10% probability up for the highest damage (you adjust for the rest), skill apply 2 time,
    50% effect up, 50% effect down, switch skill, skill change with random skill) will apply to both player.

3)  every turn, you can ban one skill enemy for the one next enemy turn.

4)  after turn, you can turn off cooldown one of three used skill, so you can use it again next turn

kalau dilakukan 4 kali, berarti menemukan 3 kali, sedangkan butuh 2 untuk aktif, biar bulat
dilakukan 8 kali, total nemu 6 kali, berarti aktif 3 kali
dmg biasa jadi 32 dmg, dmg kurang 48 dmg, jadi dmg artifak 48/3=16
